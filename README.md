# Hawaiian-Species
This repo contains analyses related to the cryopreservation and in vitro propagation of Hawaiian species in collaboration with the Lyon Arboretum. 

## Asplenium peruvianum
This project involved optimizing tissue culture media for the production of green globular bodies (GGBs) as tissues for use in cryopreservation. This analysis primarily used mixed effects models to determine the best phytohormone composition of the media to increase production and size of GGBs. Data are based on GGB count and a visual growth analysis. 

## graph_ggplot_codes.R
This file contains the code used to create summary graphs for various species' cryopreservation progress.
